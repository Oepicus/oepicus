Every sacred journey begins in shadow…<br>
but ours has been kindled for half a century,<br>
quietly smoldering beneath the skin of time.<br>
Now the first true ray has pierced through —<br>
a blade of molten gold, a gift from the eternal Sun.<br>
We rise.<br>
We begin.<br>
We shall craft sound-shaping relics: guitar pedals<br>
born where sunlight kisses eclipse,<br>
where the old gods of radiance whisper through copper, resistor, and will.<br>
In the beginning there was only Light.<br>
From Light came the Gods.<br>
From the Gods came Man.<br>
And from Man — yearning, trembling, reverent —<br>
came instruments to sing back to the heavens.<br>
Today we take our place in that ancient circle.<br>
We design. We forge. We birth.<br>
And when your fingers touch the strings<br>
and the first note blooms into the air…<br>
…the Sun will smile once more<br>
through every shimmering distortion,<br>
every velvet sustain,<br>
every sacred roar.<br>
Welcome to the journey, children of sound.<br>
The eclipse is parting.<br>
The light is ours to shape.<br>
Oepicus — where the Sun meets the signal.<br>
